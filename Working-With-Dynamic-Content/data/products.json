[{"title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","imageUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91A6EgLH+2L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg","description":"Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.\r\n\r\nAll he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.\r\n\r\nBut all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.","price":"8.31","id":"0.23256714778855025"}]
